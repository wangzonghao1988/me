一程山水一程景，行至浅深各不同

The exercise goal was probably achieved by walking more than 15k steps every night for half year. It is probably the most efficenet 
and easiest way but hard to carry on everyday.

Deeply understood for my way: no need to study too much in different fields.
C/PYTHON/GO/JS enough...      no more energy wasted in c++, although skillful already, totally not worth
这些技能仅仅是为了工作而成立的，实事上只是一门相当于手艺活人的工具，若想在这个上更进一步，需要的是更多对系统，数据，算法的了解，而我感觉自己可以深入，
但是可能不是最佳适合自己的，哎，自己选的路...
如果以生活，赚钱的角度来评价的话是否更加的不值..?

英文，越来感觉其实还蛮重要的，是否需要更加的强化一下，如果决定可就不是开玩笑的执行？或者像锻炼身体一样，只要持续不断一定时间，不知不觉就ok了？

赚钱，曾经是最感觉无所谓的，可以有技巧或者硬的，但是越来越感觉哎
